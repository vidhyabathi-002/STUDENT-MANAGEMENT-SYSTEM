# STUDENT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The Student Management System is a simple project that manages a database of student records. It uses Python for backend logic and SQL for database operations like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student data. The database (e.g., SQLite) organizes records with fields like ID, name, age, and grade.
